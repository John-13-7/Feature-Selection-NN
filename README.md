# Feature-Selection-NN
### Written in c++
### A machine learning project that implements the greedy search algorithm using leave-one-out validation and a nearest neighbor classifier. 
### Solves both forward and backward feature selection.
### Got a lot of help from my teacher assistant. Shoutout Charles.
